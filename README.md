- **ESP and Radar**: Visual aids like ESP highlight opponents and teammates, while radar shows field overviews. These use color-coded markers for threats, making strategic decisions faster. In-depth customization lets you filter by role, such as marking only defenders in red.

- **Anti-Ban Protections**: Built-in safeguards mimic natural gameplay to avoid detection. This includes randomized delays in actions and pattern variation to evade Roblox's anti-cheat systems.
